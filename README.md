A Python DICOM-RT Plan "Mangler" for Radiotherapy Quality Assurance


Ever wanted to change your radiotherapy treatment plan in weird and wonderful ways? Well - now you can. With this tool, which is essentially a wrapper to pydicom, you can modify delivery properties to intentionally deliver incorrect treatment plans. This allows you to test the sensitivity of your quality assurance methods, such as diode arrays or in-vivo dosimetry systems.
